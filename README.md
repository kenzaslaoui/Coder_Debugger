This is a generative AI project that uses LLMs to generate and debug code. 
I use the Deepseek Coder 6.7B intruct to generate code, execute it and debug the generated code if needed with a the finetuned version of Deepseek Coder 6.7B intruct. 
I finetuned the debugging model using quantized LoRA.

I could not push the finetuned model to github due to resource constraints. However, you can access the finetuned model through this link:

This is still work in progress!
